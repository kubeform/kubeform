Concepts help you to learn about the different parts of the Kubeform and the abstractions it uses.

This concept section is divided into the following modules:

- What is Kubeform?
  - [Overview](/docs/concepts/what-is-kubeform/overview.md) provides an introduction to Kubeform.
  - [Architecture](/docs/concepts/what-is-kubeform/architecture.md) provides a visual representation of Kubeform architecture. It also provides a brief overview of the components it uses.
